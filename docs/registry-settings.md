## Settings

The following settings can be configured in the registry to control the behavior of Make Me Admin. Settings should be stored in the following key:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Sinclair Community College\Make Me Admin`

To enforce settings, you should use the Group Policy templates, which are located in the installation directory. However, policy settings can be manually set in the following key:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Sinclair Community College\Make Me Admin`

<sup>1</sup> : Create a separate `REG_SZ` value for each user or group. The name of the registry value will be the SID or name of the user or group, and the value will be the desired timeout, in minutes.

<sup>2</sup> : Names of users or groups should be in the format `DOMAIN\Name`. User principal names (e.g., user@<span></span>domain.com) will not work.  
**NOTE:** If you are using local groups, `DOMAIN` should be either a single dot (`.`), the name of the computer (not recommended), or `%COMPUTERNAME%`.
