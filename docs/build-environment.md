## Build Environment

This is a list of the software you will need to successfully build Make Me Admin.

* Microsoft Visual Studio. I use Visual Studio 2019, but 2017 should be fine. I use the Professional edition at work, and I use the Community edition while at home.
  * Extensions
    * [Wix Toolset Visual Studio 2019 Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WixToolset.WixToolsetVisualStudio2019Extension)
    * [Multilingual App Toolkit v4.0 (VS 2017+)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MultilingualAppToolkit.MultilingualAppToolkit-18308)
* [Microsoft Multilingual App Toolkit 4.0](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/develop/multilingual-app-toolkit)
* [WiX Toolset 3.11](https://wixtoolset.org/releases/)


I also use some other tools while developing Make Me Admin. These are not strictly necessary to build the software, but I like them.
